Overview
Welcome to the Hybrid RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Model! This repository contains the code and resources for a novel RAG model that integrates traditional RAG techniques with a Knowledge Graph (KG) using Neo4j. The hybrid approach enhances the retrieval process by leveraging the structured information in the KG, thereby improving the generation quality and accuracy. The code is designed to run in Google Colab for ease of use and accessibility.

Features
Hybrid RAG Integration: Combines traditional RAG techniques with a Knowledge Graph.
Neo4j Database: Utilizes Neo4j for storing and querying the Knowledge Graph.
Enhanced Retrieval: Improves retrieval accuracy by using structured KG data.
Flexible Architecture: Modular design allowing easy extension and customization.
